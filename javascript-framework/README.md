## Introduction

This project, named "JavaScript Framework," is a web application built using React. It serves as a foundation for creating web applications with a modern JavaScript framework. The project includes various dependencies and scripts to facilitate development and deployment.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): A library for handling routing in React applications.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): A popular CSS framework for styling web applications.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Provides scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS.
- [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/): A toolset for measuring web performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **src**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **components**: Reusable React components used throughout the project.
  - **pages**: Individual page components for different sections of the application.
  - **utils**: Utility functions for data fetching and validation.
- **App.js**: The main application component responsible for routing.
- **index.js**: The entry point of the application.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

4. Start the development server using `npm start`.

## Scripts

- **start**: Launches the development server for local development.
- **build**: Builds the production-ready version of the application.
- **test**: Runs tests using the testing library.
- **eject**: Ejects from Create React App, allowing more advanced configuration.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint for code linting and follows the configuration provided by `react-app`. Linting helps maintain code quality and consistency.

## Browserslist

The project specifies target browsers and versions for compatibility using the Browserslist configuration. This helps generate appropriate CSS vendor prefixes based on the specified browser support.
